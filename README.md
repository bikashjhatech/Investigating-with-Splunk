# Investigating-with-Splunk

I uncovered several key details while investigating with Splunk on TryHackMe. I discovered that the adversary successfully created a backdoor user on one of the infected hosts and identified the registry key that was updated. I also determined the user the adversary was attempting to impersonate and found the command used to add the backdoor user from a remote computer. By analyzing the logs, I checked for any login attempts made by the backdoor user and identified the infected host where suspicious PowerShell commands were executed. Additionally, I determined the number of events logged for the malicious PowerShell execution and used CyberChef to decode the encoded PowerShell script, revealing the full URL involved in the attack.
